# What's New in v2.0.3

**11th Sept 2023**

- **Open Source ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³:** Play deals is now open source. You can view the source code on [Github (psuzn/app-deals)](https://github.com/psuzn/app-deals).
- **Ads No More:** I made a decision to remove all the ads. I hope this improves your experience :).
- **Kotlin Everywhere:**  Play Deals is re-written using [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform) and backend is also freshly cooked with kotlin.
